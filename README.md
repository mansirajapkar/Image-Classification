# Image-Classification
This Project include building Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which identifies different types of flowers such as Daisy, Dandelions, Tulips, Roses, and Sunflowers . It demonstrate the data preprocessing, build CNN Model, add data augmentation &amp; dropout, Compile, train and evaluate model, plot accuracy/loss curves and at the end save model.
